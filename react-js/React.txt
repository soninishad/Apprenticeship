INTRODUCTION TO REACT JS
*******************************

React js: Two types of Applications 

**Interview ques**
1.SPA :-single page application  
2. PWP -: progressive web pages or  progressive web framework (pwf).


Technology required /tobe covered in reactjs

1.core and adv js
2.spa and pwf

SPA VS MPA  [SINGLE PAGE  APP VS  MULTIPAGE APP ]  


How to install React-js
************************
1. Library :- collections of functios and fucntionalities . 
lib is light weight scrce code which is prebulit , contains in built fucntions  , help in fucntionilty
dance -> thk hai  okk , charracter le aao



tent -> tent
food -> wala food
utensils-> utensils wla

2. framework:- collections of  multiple  library

framework is heavy weight,  stationery ki dukaan .
  dance -> thk hai  okk , charracter bhi valable hoajage.

Event management-- Saaari vaiavastha is avaliable  in here , like bootstrap. 


eg:- 
React -js install  -> services -> create react - app -< bat file 
using this we install package  using node 
 folder -> node modules



frameowk ke andr mul lib and usme 
ek folder ke  andr --> agr many lib hogi toh wo package bnajata hai 
aur lib >collections of functios and fucntionalities . 




How to install react -js
************************
1. using :- content /cloud cdn 
2. download install and use 
 for this we have to use npm 

Questions:-
Q)we are using react js then why installing node js?


ANS )cuz it provides server runtime enivronment 


what is meaning of server side runtime environment?

Inorder to reviw we need to review the client  and server architecture , wherever we say 
client is reuqesting server , it means that request is sent from client to dns server  after that, each request is 
hopped from one server to  another server
this way onne server which send request from on eto another server become a client for another server 
{based on ip address connection made}.

hence any system can be made to behave  as server   but there are some cretiteia.
hence  our client cannot send the request to server to directly  download /install  packages  form sever .
hence instead making  the entire  system sever , we try to provide  the enironment  to the sytem.
hence server  side enivironment  which enbales  the js  as the useed as backend services that runtime enivronmrnt
is nothing but node js  .



Architecture of  node 
*************************

node js is server side , made on vb engine--> it is v8version of which is exe file me generate kiya gya hai 
use :- virtual changes me kaam hota hai(aise canges which is gernerated in  real time  without allocating memory )
, non blocking mechanism ( paraeell working )


Google chrome : - dev tools -> environment provide dev  , easy develpment
                                   |
                                v1 engine-> runtime js and runtime dom , he is physics ka taecher 


virtual changes -> virtual dom -> vb dev tool exe --> node js exe 

vb Engine


2. Non blocking mechanism in node js  (asynchronous )




HOW TO CHECK NODE INSTALL OR NOT
open cmd type node -v  -> 18.x
                      npm - v  --> 8.19.2


hw to run using node 
 node filename .js


how to run using npm


you cannot directly run js file, for that you have to declare multiple package(modules)

every file in node is module  and collection of one or  more module is caled package and dvery
 package acn be executed using npm  and package .json


questions          intervirw ques

What is package .json
*************************
it is special file  which tells svevrything abou package.
 it is static file.it in cules info like title , description author name,git url , jira url ,it also insvules scripts (use to run commands) , dependcies (other packages) means if
 one package is depende on another packge 
if you download one packge all other packgaes ealted to that packages are downloaded.


How to make package .json file
1. make a file package.json
2. write code in pure json.

eg:_

{
    "title":"myfirstpackage",
    "description":"this isd emo package",
    "lisense":"MIT",
    "athour":"Salem",
    "dependencies": [],
    "scripts": {
     "dev":"node p1.js"}
}



2 method 
************
npm init   khud dalo values
                                                          ----------------> on git bash
npm init - y - dumy package.json  

you will be asked to fill details  and cmfirm and automatically package.json file will be created .

what are dependecies:-
1:-these are packages or sub packages which will install as soon as we run npm install command
dependecy are also called as package which dependent ,other for running

interview question:-
npm will install

starting first app in react
**********************************
in order to make first project of react.
we need a service called create-react-app.cmd
or create-react-app bat file for create first app
gallary page =>gallary.html
faq page=>page.html
contact page=>contact.html
...........
..........
..........
Every project is a app.and every time to build 
new app you need to download react app from
scratch()
 
1:-dev=> developer point of view
2:-out of the box =>by default.
3:-scratch=> from starting
4:-boyler plate:-starting template
(some prexisting them or code)
5:-hunch=>curiosity
5:-KT=>knowledge transfer.
7:-On Bench=> no project alignment
8:-test=>tester point of view.
how to install react:-
npm glowal install craete-react-app<= first time process

how to craete reacte react app
***********************
npx create-react-app<app name or project-name>
what is difference between npm and npx?
npm:-node package manager
npx:-node package executable

npm:node package manager:install package from 
cloud server
https:/nodejs.org
and
https://www.npmjs.com/=>cloud repository
all packageof node are installed.

npx:node package executable.
npm---------->p1.js---------->execute
       npm----> |
                      |
                       package.json(declare this js is module)   
                        npx=>execute this package.
note:: every time you download app you will
need internt connection(+data pack)

***************************9/12/2023*************************
_______________________________________________________________________
lets  us postmortem perform of src
********************************

app.js
app.css
index



secret menu:in devloper tools
console->right click->
1:normal reload
2:hard reload
3:-empty catch and hard reload
or
clear site data menu:-
ctrl+shift+i or inspect>application > storage
right hand
checkbox: including third party cookies clear side data

important extention used during react development
****************************************************
1:postman app or thundebird client extention vs code
2:-react-dev tools in chrom
3:-cookies editor in chrome
4:-wappalyzer in chrome

postman app:-worlds biggest tool ,for testing REST-API.
postman have lot of tools for collaberation,testing,documentation
security restapi with team.
it is a heavy tool

thundebird client:-very light weight extension for testing restapi 
it is lite version (sasta) postman.

difference  virtual dom and real dom
***********************************************
1:real dom :actual dom or tags ,predefined tags or dom 
virtual dom :its uses, custum tags and virtual tags which are
called component.

2:real dom :foundation=> tags
virtual dom :foundation =>nodes/components

3.real dom  data transfer->sequential
virtual dom :data transfer->parent to child.
this feature is called props.(properties or attributes)

4:real dom: statically changed.
virtual dom: dynamically change.

5:real dom: data security less
virtual dom:greater then real dom?
in order to change choild we need to change parent.
and in order to change this paraent (single this parent is a called of 
another paraent you need change that parent and in order
to change that parent in need this parent........)
note:- if you want to transfer the data from child to parent
in react it is not possible ,for that we need ,redux.

6:- real dom use :html syntex
virtual dom :jsx syntax (js +xml)
