                    <h1>Discover Menu</h1>
                    <p>Menu planning in food service means planning a menu for the restaurant, or a food service
                        establishment. A menu is a detailed list of options offered to the customer when they come to
                        eat or drink at the restaurant or bar. They offer a wide variety of choices, and are priced
                        differently based on the ingredients used, time taken to cook the dishes, or the season and
                        availability of ingredients used. Menus can be different based on the meals of the day, such as
                        breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Menu planning in food service helps the chef take charge of the
                        kitchen, keep a tab on available ingredients, and help the restaurant make a profit.
                        Generally, a food menu, beverage menu, and drinks menu or bar menu can be found in the
                        restaurant. A typical rule of thumb is to keep the list in a menu under 30, so as to be able to
                        manage it well. Other than that, there are static menus that never change, and which the
                        customers use to select what they have always liked or wanted. A daily (or single-use) menu has
                        a very short length, and is usually changed on a daily basis. Cycle menus run for a specific
                        length of time only, and are more popular in non-commercial food services, such as hospitals,
                        schools, institutes, universities, etc.

                    <p>Dairy Queen does more than just Blizzards. The Chicken Strip Basket—chicken served with french
                        fries, Texas toast, and a choice of sauce—is its signature meal.
                        The Filet-O-Fish owes its popularity to being a solid alternative to a burger for
                        non-beef-eaters, especially during Lent when there is a tremendous uptick in sales, as many
                        people have given up eating meat on Fridays.
                        Little Caesars is best known for pizza, but coming in at a close second is Crazy Bread, its
                        much-loved parmesan-encrusted garlic breadsticks.
                        Five Guys is known for being "picky" about fries, only using Idaho potatoes, which are known for
                        being particularly dense.
                        Wendy's is the only fast-food company in the U.S. that sells baked potatoes, which is surprising
                        because America is traditionally a meat-and-potatoes kind of place. It likely owes part of its
                        success to that novelty.
                        This fried combo features Alaskan Pollock, along with two sides and hushpuppies. If you're not
                        into fried fish, some other popular items at the chain are the grilled salmon and shrimp tacos,
                        along with a shrimp variety platter.
                        If you take one of the most popular fast-food recipes and make it conveniently bite-sized,
                        ta-da! You have another hit on your hands.</p>
