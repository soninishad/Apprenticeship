Javascript for loop in hindi  :---
The for statement creates a loop that is executed as long as a condition is true.

The loop will continue to run as long as the condition is true. It will only stop when the condition becomes false.

for/in - 
loops through the properties of an object

while -
loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true .

do/while - 
loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop while a specified condition is true.
