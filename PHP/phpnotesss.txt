 INTRODUCTON TO PHP  WITH LAREVAL FRAMEWORK
***********************************************************

1.Programming language
2. Software technology
3.Frameworks
4.Web architecture
5. Php intro
6. Pre-requsite of php
7.Syntax of php 


Programming language in general terms :- 
*********************************************

Programming lang provides us  raw materials for software development.

Programming lang provide  syntaxes (Rules)and smentics (guidelines ) for software development .

By using programming language you can develop diffrent kinds of software , compilers .. etc.

C , C++ , java , python , php  etc ,  are some popular programming languages.


Software technology                       (Interview Question )
**********************
Software technology  are non - installable softwares ,  but the software developed by using Software technology are installable . 


Two types of Software technology
**********************************

1.Open source Technology

 Source code of Open source Technology is available for software engineers  and  software engineers can make changes in 
 Open source Technology.
Examples:- java , php python , react , node , angular ..

2.Closed source Technology 

Source code of    Closed source Technology is not available for software engineers  and so   software engineers cannot make changes in 
 Closed source Technology
Examples:-  All Microsoft technology ,  IOS etc 




 
NOTE:-
*******
-OS made in c or c++ only  , cuz they give hardware interaction permission , python se nii krte kyu ki uske liye addtional h/w use krte hai Raspberry pie which mad on core linux .
-Assembly lang se isliye nii krte kyu ki user frindly nii hai .

-Windows  made on c++   : owner Microsoft  :- Used in daily life
-Linux and unix made on c   : owner . . . . .  . . . :- Used by programmers 
-Android is linux based mobile os system.

UNIX VS LINUX 
****************
UNIX VS LINUX   :- me whi diffrence hai jo   DOS aur  Windows me hai
 DOS(command prompt) :- CUI based operating system. 
 windows(GUI ):   GUI based 

DOS is a part  Windows, similarly unix is a part of linux ..


FRAMEWORK    (INTERVIEW QUESTION)
********************************************

Frameworks are installble softwares ,  and they provide us pre-designed Architecture . by using framework , you can develop software applications more easily.

INTRODUCTON TO PHP

C:\wamp64\www\PHP BRIJESH  uske baad

go to new tab ==== = = > localhost/myphp



***********************************************************************************

PHP  is interpreted language . 

<?php
$myVar="swati";
echo "hello".$myVar;
?>
*********************************************************************************

NOTE :-


Enclosed all code in form tag and set method as post 

like this :-

<?php

//code of php 

?>


<form method ="post">

//code 
</form>




php code to recieve value of input:-

$n1=$_POST["n1"];
$n2=$_POST["n2"];
$op=$_POST["op"];

isset():-  isset() function in php is used to cheeck that variable is set 
(variable is initialized)or not.
if(isset($_POST["calc"]))
{
$n1=$_POST["n1"];
$n2=$_POST["n2"];
$op=$_POST["op"];// op me add,sub,mult,div ho sakta hai.
if($op=="add")
{
$res=$n1+$n2; 
}
}

Loop Control:-

If you have a block of code which you want to execute repeatedly up to given 
condition in true. then you can use a loop control. in php there are four types of loop
controls:-


1. while loop

Syntax:-

Initialization of loop counter;
while(condition)
{
// code
Updation of loop counter;
}



2. for loop
syntax:-

for(Initialization;Condition;Updation)
{
//code
}
3. do-which loop
4. foreach loop


Array in php:- Array is a collection of different type values in php.
An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.

create an array in php:-In php, the array() function is used to create an array.
array();
eg:-
$arr=array("ram", "shyam","swati");
$arr[0]="ram";
$arr[1]="shyam";
$arr[2]="swati";


Types  of array in php:- 

In php there are three types array

1. Indexed Array:- 

Array with numeric index is called indexed array.
$cars=array("bmw","alto","nano");
$cars[0]="bmw";
$cars[1]="alto";
$cars[2]="nano";

2. Associative array:-

 Array with key and value pair is called Associative array.
"key"=>"value"
$employee=array("empid"=>101,"empname"=>"ram","salary"=>50000);
$employee["empid"]=101;
$employee["empname"]="ram";
$employee["salary"]="50000";


3. Multidimensinal array:- 

A Multidimensinal array is an array containing one or more arrays.
$A=array(
array(1,2,3),
array(4,5,6),
array(7,8,9)
);

A=  0 1 2
|--      --
| 1  2  3  |  0       
| 4  5  6  |  1
| 7  8  9  |  2
|          |



FUNCTIONS IN PHP
*************************


       


Constructor in php
**********************

Constructor is special method which is used to initialize variables , it is called automatically as soon as object is created.

syntax:-

function __construct(if any parameter )

{
//code   -> to initialize variables
}

What is Inheritance?

Inheritance in OOP = When a class derives from another class.
The child class will inherit all the public and protected properties and methods from the parent class. In addition, it can have its own properties and methods.
An inherited class is defined by using the extends keyword.


Protected properties or methods can be accessed within the class and by classes derived from that class. What does that mean?

SOL:- A protected method (intro()) from outside the class, we will receive an error. public methods will work fine!



Types of inheritance supported in php 
********************************************

In php , three types of inheritance are supported 

1. Single inheritance
2. Hierracricahal inhreitance
3. Multilevel inheritance



Single inheritance 
********************
Single base classs and Single derived class.

Heirarchical inhreitance <===> (Tree data structure)
**************************************************
There is  single base classs and  multiple  devried class .

class A {
//code 
}

class B extends A {
// code 
}

class C extends A {
// code
}

Multilevel inheritance (N<==>N)
**************************************
There are n base class and n derived class

class A {
//code 
}

class B extends A {
// code 
}

class C extends B {
// code
}



polymorphism in php

one thing many forms


1. method overloading:- can be performed by in php  by function __call()

syntax:-

fuunction __ call($name , $args){

}



2. method overriding :_

rules:_

1. class must be inherited
2. base class  method and derived class methods  must be same name
3. base class method parameters and dervied  class  method parameters  must be same


DATABASE CONNECTIVITY IN PHP USING MYSQL:_

msqli_connect: This function is used in php to connect database of mysql with php pplication , in this function we pass four parameters

$con= mysqli_connect("localhost", "root","2000","userdb");



msqli_query():-  This function is used in php to execute sql statements 

msqli_query($con , "select * from userinfo ");

SQL STATEMENT TO INSERT VALES IN SPECIFIC  COLUMNS

$query = "insert into userinfo (username ,  gender , address ,  contactno , emailaddress ,  password) 
values ( '$username' , '$gender' , '$address' ,  '$contactno' ; '$emailaddress' ,  '$password' )";

Scalar type declarations
Return type declarations
Null coalescing operator (??)
Spaceship operator
Constant arrays using define()

Closure::call method
Group use declaration
Generator return expressions
Generator delegation
Space ship operator




array()
array_change_key_case()
array_chunk()
count()
sort()
